### OVERVIEW

- Approach/Ideology
- Challenges
- Successful Group Practices 
- How/Why we selected a project idea 


### APPROACH AND IDEOLOGY 

**Components:**
  - Dictionaries
  - Lists 
  - Global and local variables
  - If/elif/else statements
  - While loops
  - Print/Prompt/Input statements
 
**Key Tasks:**
- Establishing iSchool Rules
- A dictionary used to simulate a deck of cards
- Draw function using random.choice()
- Summing number of cards in hand/drawed and total card value
- HIT or STAY 
- Simulating up to 5 player draws
- PUSH (Ties; Dealer Card Value == Player Card Value)
- BUST (card value > 21)
- Aces ( == 11 versus == 1)

 
### STEPS TO FUNCTIONALITY

1. Dealer vs. Player Variables
2. Do you want to play (Yes/No?)
3. random.choice() player 2 cards
4. State keys (cards in hand) and value
5. HIT/STAY?
6. If hit, random.choice() another card
7. State keys and value
8. If Ace choose 1 or 11
9. HIT (instance 1, 2, 3, 4, and/or 5)
10. WIN? LOST? BUST? PUSH

### CHALLENGES

- Aces to be valued at 1 or 11?
- Dealing with invalid user inputs
- Ties
- First hand == 21
- Class Storage Name as player & Dealer
- Creating Rules (Computer Logic vs Human Logic)
- User Friendliness
